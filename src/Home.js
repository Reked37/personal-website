      <h2>Who am I?</h2>
      <div>I am an indivdual who love to learn and wants to contribute to the world. I graduated from Kent State University with my bachelors in psychology
        While I was at school I particpated in many school activities such as co-found and playing for the Kent State Esports organization where I played league of legends for my college and
        recieved scholarship. After my first year of college I had the amazing opportunity to be a ⚡ Flashguide ⚡ or a student orientation leader where I helped welcome the new upcoming freshmen
        get acclimated to the university. Lastly, I had the opportunity to study abroad at the University of Liecester in England for a semester! Where I traveled to the city of Bath and Stonehedge as well as
        toured the Warner Brother Studio where Harry Potter was filmed.
